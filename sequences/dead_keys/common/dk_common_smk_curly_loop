# Common Dead Keys | Curly Loop Rules
# [AUTHOR]: Carlos González Sanz
#
# > The purpose of this file is to store default
# > Compose rules for the diacritical curl and loop
# > across multiple writing systems.
#
# [NOTE]: This diacritic will be represented as [U035B]
# ("͛", Combining Zigzag ABove) due to the diacritical curl
# as well as the diacritical loop lacking proper representation in Unicode
# as separate combining diacritics.
#

# Basic combinations
<U035B> <space> : "͛"    # Combining zigzag above
<U035B> <U035B> : "͛"    # Combining zigzag above
