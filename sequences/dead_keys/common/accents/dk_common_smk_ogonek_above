# [NOTE]: This diacritic will be represented as [U1DCE]
# ("᷎", Combining Ogonek Above) due to the fact that
# there currently is no alias for the aforementioned
# character in "xkbcommon-keysyms.h".
#

# Basic combinations
<U1DCE> <space>     : "᷎"    # Combining ogonek above
<U1DCE> <U1DCE>     : "᷎"    # Combining ogonek above
<U1DCE> <less>      : "̨"    # Combining ogonek
