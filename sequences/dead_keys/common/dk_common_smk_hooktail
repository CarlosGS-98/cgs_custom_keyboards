# Common Dead Keys | Triple Tail Rules
# [AUTHOR]: Carlos González Sanz
#
# > The purpose of this file is to store default
# > Compose rules for the diacritical tail as
# > well as the palatal and retroflex hooks
# > across multiple writing systems.
#
# [NOTE]: This diacritic will be represented as [U0359]
# ("͙", Combining Asterisk Below) due to the regular (implosive) tail
# lacking proper representation in Unicode
# as a separate combining diacritic.
#

# Basic combinations
<U0359> <space>             : "͙"    # Combining asterisk below
<U0359> <U0359>             : "͙"    # Combining asterisk below
<U0359> <less> <less>       : "̡"    # Combining palatal hook        | (Its letters will start with the combination <U0359> <less> (...))
<U0359> <greater> <greater> : "̢"    # Combining retroflex hook      | (Its letters will start with the combination <U0359> <greater> (...))
<U0359> <comma> <comma>     : "˞"   # Modifier letter rhotic hook   | (Its letters will start with the combination <U0359> <comma> (...))
<U0359> <period> <period>   : "˞"   # Modifier letter rhotic hook   | (Its letters will start with the combination <U0359> <period> (...))
